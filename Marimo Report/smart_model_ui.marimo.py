        ###**Abstract**

        - This project presents an interactive machine learning application developed using the Marimo framework.
        - It enables users to select, train, and evaluate classification models on a Smart Meter DDoS attack dataset.
        - Essential machine learning modules are integrated, along with dynamic data preprocessing, model selection, and visualization of results.
        - Here, we have emphasised 3 important models which might help in understanding the data provided by our dataset and how they help us identify the label or the class: **Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression.**
        - The application emphasizes modularity, user interactivity, and streamlined evaluation, providing a flexible and intuitive platform for understanding model performance and comparison.

        ###**Introduction**

        This project detects anomalies in smart meter readings using machine learning.

        Analysis is done across MATLAB, Marimo, and Weka platforms.

        Models like Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression are applied.

        The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing.

        The goal is to identify abnormal patterns to ensure reliable and secure energy monitoring.

        ###**Dataset Description**

        **Datasets Used:**

        Normal Traffic: Contains clean network traffic without any attacks or anomalies.

        TCP_SYN Attack with Sniffing: Captures traffic during a TCP SYN flood attack while network sniffing is active.

        TCP_SYN Attack without Sniffing: Captures traffic during a TCP SYN flood attack without any additional sniffing activity.

        **Feature Categories:**

        Network Info: Identifies source and destination (e.g., Src_ip, Dst_ip, Protocol).

        Traffic Stats: Measures data flow rate (e.g., flow_byts_s, flow_pkts_s).

        Packet Details: Tracks packet size variations (e.g., Pkt_len_max, Pkt_len_mean).

        TCP Flags: Identifies connection behavior (e.g., Syn_flag_cnt, Ack_flag_cnt).

        Time-Based: Detects timing irregularities (e.g., Flow_duration, Flow_iat_mean).

        Labels:

        Indicate whether the traffic is Normal or an Anomaly, serving as ground truth for classification.

        ###**Methodology**

        **Dataset Preparation:**
        Load the smart meter readings from the CSV file.

        **Data Splitting:**
        Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing sets.

        **Platform-Specific Implementation:**

        In **MATLAB**: Apply Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree models.

        In **Marimo**: Use Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree models.

        In **Weka**: Apply Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree classifiers.

        **Model Training and Evaluation:**
        Train the models using the training data and evaluate their performance on the testing data.

        ###**Result Comparison:**
        Compare the accuracy and performance metrics of the models across different platforms.
